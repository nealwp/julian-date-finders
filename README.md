## JulianDateFinder
A quick tool for converting dates to Julian Dates and vice-versa.

## Motivation
Folks in my organization use Julian Dates frequently, and they often have to convert a Julian Date to calendar date. This was mostly being done with a paper matrix chart where users would line up a month column with
a day row and get the corresponding Julian Date. I got tired of eyeballing the chart/people making errors eyeballing the chart, so I wrote a tiny window app to do the conversion. 

## Tech/framework used
Visual Basic Script (.vbs)

## Features
* Coverts Julian Dates to regular dates
* Converts regular dates to Julian Dates
* Displays current Julian Date in window title

## How to use?
Download the .vbs file, place anywhere and double-click to run. Enter a Julian Date to convert to a calendar date or vice-versa.
